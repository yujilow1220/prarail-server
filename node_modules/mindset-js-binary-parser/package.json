  "readme": "Mindset-js-binary-parser\n========================\n\nA nodejs module for parsing binary data for Mindset/Mindwave headsets by Neurosky. A caveat to notice: at the very moment I havn't implemented dynamical device recognition, thus the initial device's ID (tty.MindWaveMobile-DevA) has been hardcoded. Use <code>ls /dev/tty.*</code> (Mac os) to figure out your certain device's ID and substitute it.\n\nPlease, familiarise yourself also with my <a href=\"https://github.com/dkulichkin/twimpress\" target=\"_blank\">Twimpress</a> project has been made on top of this parser and representing a basic visualization of headset's data, so thus might happen be a good part for bootstrapping your further javascript-based application."
